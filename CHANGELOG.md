# Changelog

All notable changes to TRACE are documented here.
Format loosely follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]
- Added real screenshots (Live Dashboard, Lap Analyst, Race Analyst) to the
  README, replacing the placeholder comment
- Added a real standalone macOS app (`TRACE.app`), built automatically on a
  GitHub-hosted Apple Silicon runner via `build-macos.yml` -- no physical
  Mac needed on this end. Replaces the old "email a Mac user and ask them
  to build one" flow. Attaches to the GitHub Release on every `vX.Y.Z` tag.
- Added a test suite (`tests/`) covering car/track DB lookups, settings
  persistence, and a full Salsa20 decrypt+parse round-trip against a
  synthetic packet
- Added CI (GitHub Actions): tests run on Python 3.10–3.13 on every push/PR,
  plus `ruff` linting
- Added a trusted-publishing workflow (`publish.yml`) that builds and
  uploads to PyPI automatically on a `vX.Y.Z` tag push -- no more manual
  local `twine upload`
- Added type hints to the public API (`cars`, `tracks`, `udp`) and a
  `py.typed` marker so IDEs get proper autocomplete for `import gt7telem`
- Added issue templates, a PR template, and `CODEOWNERS`

## [0.1.3] - 2026-08-21

- Added `CONTRIBUTING.md` and this changelog

## [0.1.2] - 2026-08-20

  cars have been added since the last update)

  `gt7telem` CLI launcher for Live Dashboard, Lap Analyst, and Race Analyst

  public API, and credits
